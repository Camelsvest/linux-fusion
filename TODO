Improve performance by using a hash table or a faster approach
for looking up ids.

Implement defering/blocking of SIGSTOP while a Skirmish is locked
by the process. This will avoid rare deadlocks when pressing Ctrl-Z
in the terminal where a DirectFB slave application has been started.

Maybe implement other Fusion parts like Arena or Object(Pool).
