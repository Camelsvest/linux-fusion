Improve performance of reference code by using a hash table or a
faster approach.

Implement Skirmish with the advantage of defering/blocking SIGSTOP
while a Skirmish is locked by the process. This will avoid rare
deadlocks when pressing Ctrl-Z in the terminal where a DirectFB
slave application has been started.

Implement other Fusion parts like Reactor or Object(Pool).
