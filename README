Easy installation without kernel patch (recommended)
-----------------------------------------------------

1) Copy linux/include/linux/fusion.h to the location where DirectFB
   can find it, e.g. "/usr/include/linux/".

2) Check the KERNEL_SOURCE variable pointing to the kernel source tree,
   default path is "/usr/src/linux".

3) Run 'make' and copy "fusion.o" to your module directory,
   e.g. "/lib/modules/2.4.22/". Either run 'insmod fusion' manually
   or add "fusion" to "/etc/modules".

4) Create the fusion device(s) if not using devfs:

	mkdir /dev/fusion
	mknod /dev/fusion/0 c 253 0

	...if you need more than one session

	mknod /dev/fusion/1 c 253 1
	mknod /dev/fusion/2 c 253 2

	...and so on (currently limited to eight sessions)


Alternative installation using a kernel patch
----------------------------------------------

1) Patch your kernel

	patch -p1 < fusion-full-linux-2.4.22.patch

2) Enable the character device driver module "Fusion Kernel Device",
   build and install modules, insmod fusion.

3) Make sure /usr/include/linux points to the patched kernel tree
   so that <linux/fusion.h> is found at configure time of DirectFB.

4) See step four of the quick installation.


Development installation
-------------------------

Instead of using the full patch you can use the partial patch
and add the new files afterwards (possibly with CVS sub directory).

	patch -p1 < fusion-part-linux-2.4.22.patch

Copy everything in the "linux" sub directory into the kernel tree.
