Quick installation
-------------------

Patch your kernel:

	patch -p1 < fusion-full-linux-2.4.20-rc1.patch

Enable the character device driver module "Fusion Kernel Device",
build and install modules, insmod fusion. Maybe check /proc/misc.

Create the fusion device:

	mknod /dev/fusion c 10 23

Make sure /usr/include/linux points to the patched kernel tree
so that <linux/fusion.h> is found at configure time of DirectFB.



Development installation
-------------------------

Instead of using the full patch you can use the partial patch
and add the new files afterwards (possibly with CVS sub directory).

	patch -p1 < fusion-part-linux-2.4.20-rc1.patch

Copy everything in the "linux" sub directory into the kernel tree.
