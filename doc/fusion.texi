@chapter Introduction

@section What is Fusion?

Fusion is a high level IPC API providing mechanisms
for master/slave environments.

@section Master/Slave vs. Client/Server

In client/server environments clients delegate every operation
to the server which has sole access to shared resources.
Such environments suffer from the overhead caused by

@itemize @bullet
@item Command encoding, decoding
@item Transport of command packets
@item Transport of data referenced by commands
@item Context switches between client and server processes
@item Strict seperation of client and server implementation
@end itemize

The master/slave approach eliminates this overhead by virtually
merging the processes at the lower level of their implementation.
This way of making multiple processes look like multiple threads
gave Fusion its name and includes

@itemize @bullet
@item Shared memory for data normally held solely by the server
@item Fine grained messaging for virtually local event handlers and callbacks
@item Advanced locking techniques for synchronization and access control
@item Framework for distributed allocation and cleanup of resources
@end itemize


@chapter Design

This chapter will explain some fundamental concepts of Fusion.
